# Notes for polygrid-backend — from the frontend

Things the frontend finds while building against the API. The frontend
treats the backend as read-only, so items here wait for a backend
session. Each item gives where the problem is, what it does, and what
the frontend needs. Add new items at the top and remove them once
they're fixed.

## Open

Nothing open right now.

## Resolved

The backend fixed every item from the first list in commit `be7859f`:
- search results now include `id`;
- granting a subscription ends the previous one;
- the overview's money total is split by currency;
- `GET /api/users` has `?q=` search and admins can read it;
- verification listings include the template's labels;
- customer_care can open verification documents;
- the whole platform is locked to USD (`PLATFORM_CURRENCY`).

The frontend now uses all of these. The dev database's NGN data (the Pro
plan and Charles Okonkwo's services) was converted to USD through the API.
